In the day-to-day activities of being a digital humanist, I end producing a lot of miniature projects.

Most of them I write up on a blog somewhere, but a few are more stand-alone endeavors with their own site. If you&#8217;re interested in this, you might also want to look at my [maps and visualizations gallery](http://benschmidt.org/maps-visualizations-gallery/).

Here are some of them, arranged roughly by size and recency. Some of these are big, some are little, and most are open-source.

[Prochronisms](http://prochronism.com): Exploring language dynamics by tracking anachronisms.

[Bookworm](http://bookworm.culturomics.org): Multifaceted ways of viewing libraries as data. (With members of the Rice Cultural Observatory and previously, the Cultural Observatory @ Harvard). More info at the link.

[Changing Degrees](http://benschmidt.org/Degrees): Tracing higher education history through the degrees that were awarded.

[Coverspace](http://benschmidt.org/projects/coverspace): Dynamic in-browser interfaces to historical images.
