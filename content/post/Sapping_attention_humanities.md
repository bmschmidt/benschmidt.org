I put up a new post at Sapping Attention about ![how bad the decline in humanities majors has been since 2013](http://sappingattention.blogspot.com/2018/07/mea-culpa-there-is-crisis-in-humanities.htmls). In short, it's been bad enough to make me recant earlier statements of mine about the long-term health of the humanities discipline.
